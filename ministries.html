    <li>
    <h4>Preaching<a name="top"></a></h4>
    Preaching is essential to vitality and health of the church. We are called to &ldquo;preach the Word&rdquo; because the Word is God&rsquo;s means for salvation of the lost and growth of the believer (2 Tim 4:2; Rom 10:17). As we preach the Word of God, the glorious truth of the gospel reveals the face of Christ to us, which leads to a Christ centered, joyful life. At COHBC we are committed to faithful, expositional preaching of biblical truth. We preach through biblical books seeking to understand the truth so that it can be applied to our daily lives.</li>
    <li>
    <h4>Teaching</h4>
    We offer two 10&nbsp;week sessions of Equipping Essentials classes, a wonderful opportunity for ongoing fellowship, theological sharpening and spiritual growth. Classes are held before the service, 8:30 - 9:30 am.</li>
    <li>
    <h4>Care Groups</h4>
    COHBC Care Groups intentionally shepherd God&rsquo;s people through discovery Bible study, authentic relationships and caring prayer in a highly relational setting. Starting September 20th these groups meet weekly throughout the Spokane region and are the primary way that the people of COHBC are cared for in all aspects of life. The Elders of COHBC desire that everyone at COHBC be involved in a Care group for mutual care and encouragement. If you have questions and for information on how to get involved in a Care group contact Kurt Kimball at (509)456-7321.</li>
    <li>
    <h4><a href="/templates/default.asp?id=47923&amp;PID=728317">World Outreach through Missions</a></h4>
    Through your faithful giving, COHBC supports missionaries that are ministering around the world for the glory of God.</li>
    <li>
    <h4>Music Ministry</h4>
    Music is an expressive way that we praise our God for all he is and for what he has done. Singing in the church is also a way we mutually edify one another with the truths of the gospel. At COHBC, we like to think our music is neither traditional nor contemporary, but Christ centered. No matter how old or new the song might be, or what musical style it is, we want it to reveal the glories of Christ and the wonders of His cross work for us. If you interested in serving in this ministry, please call Bob at 270-3961 or email him at <a href="mailto:bdelateur@cohbc.org?subject=Music%20Ministry"><span class="gI">bdelateur@cohbc.org</span></a>. <br />
    &nbsp;</li>
    <li>
    <h4>College Ministry</h4>
    If you are college aged, you are invited to our COHBC college ministry Thursday evenings, at 7pm at the church building ( 1620 N Monroe ). The College Ministry meets every Thursday at the same time and location. <br />
    Please join us for dinner, Bible study, time of prayer, fun and fellowship. If you have any questions, please call Roland at 893-8644 or email him at <a href="mailto:rsanchez@cohbc.org?subject=College%20Ministry"><span class="gI">rsanchez@cohbc.org</span></a>.

    <h4>Youth<a name="youth_ministries"></a></h4>
    At COHBC we have a couple things going on for middle and high school age youth:
    <ul>
        <li><b>Youth Encouragement Nights</b>&mdash;<u>Every Other</u> Friday Night, (see the church bulletin)&nbsp;<br />
        <br />
        On every other Friday evening,&nbsp; we will be providing an opportunity for the youth (Jr. High--High School) of COHBC to get together to be encouraged in their walks with Christ. We will be studying the book of Colossians in order to help young people see Christ more clearly and know how to display Him in all aspects of their lives. These will meet at our house ( 2718 S. Manito Blvd. ) at 7 pm every other Friday night.<br />
        &nbsp;<br />

    <h4>Serving Opportunities<a name="ministry_serving"></a></h4>
